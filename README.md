# Â¡Wellcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am JosÃ©, a technology enthusiast with special interests in Data Science, Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, among others. In this space, I share a bit of what I am learning along the way. Some of the projects you will find among my repositories are shared with friends and colleagues, while others are personal ones.

## ðŸ”§ Skills
- **Programming languages:** Python, C++, SQL, PL-SQL, GAS
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, AWS, Power BI, PLSQL Developer

## ðŸš€ Some projects
- [My first LLM chat](https://github.com/josemza/Local-Chat-Streamlit.git): This project is a local lightweight chat application built with ```Streamlit``` for the frontend, leveraging ```Ollama``` to interact with a Large Language Model (LLM). It uses ```SQLite``` to store chat history, ensuring persistence across sessions. The backend is developed in ```Python```, making it easy to extend and integrate with additional features.
- [PetMatch - Prototype for lost pet search](https://github.com/josemza/PetMatch.git): It is a web prototype that performs lost pet searches using image similarity with Deep Learning tools such as ```CNN```, ```Transfer Learning```, and ```Embeddings```. This project is part of the course "Data Analytics para la toma de decisiones" offered in the Master's program in Computer Science at the Graduate School of the University of Engineering and Technology (UTEC), taught by Germain Garcia, Ph.D. in Computer Science.
- [Navigator - Value Iteration & Policy Iteration algorithms for solving MDPs](https://github.com/josemza/navigator.git): This project involves the use of two classic algorithms to solve Markov Decision Problems (MDP): ```Value Iteration Algorithm``` and ```Policy Iteration Algorithm```. The project evaluates the performance of these algorithms by applying them to a problem of movements in a 2D grid.
